Entity Framework:
DB programming by entity model.
here the framework creates the namespace and classes which correspond to each database and table and member functions for the various db operations are also created.
data->ado.net entity data model->generate from database.
This works for sql server as well as ms access basically for whatever you give in connection string.
SingleorDefault means it could return a single value or a default value
